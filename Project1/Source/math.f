C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C
C     The subroutine  DP1VLU  uses the coefficients generated by  DPOLFT
C     to evaluate the polynomial fit of degree  L , along with the first
C     NDER  of its derivatives, at a specified point.  Computationally
C     stable recurrence relations are used to perform this task.
C
C     The parameters for  DP1VLU  are
C
C     Input -- ALL TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         L -      the degree of polynomial to be evaluated.  L  may be
C                  any non-negative integer which is less than or equal
C                  to  NDEG , the highest degree polynomial provided
C                  by  DPOLFT .
C         NDER -   the number of derivatives to be evaluated.  NDER
C                  may be 0 or any positive value.  If NDER is less
C                  than 0, it will be treated as 0.
C         X -      the argument at which the polynomial and its
C                  derivatives are to be evaluated.
C         A -      work and output array containing values from last
C                  call to  DPOLFT .
C
C     Output -- ALL TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         YFIT -   value of the fitting polynomial of degree  L  at  X
C         YP -     array containing the first through  NDER  derivatives
C                  of the polynomial of degree  L .  YP  must be
C                  dimensioned at least  NDER  in the calling program.

C
C     Abstract
C
C     The subroutine  PVALUE  uses the coefficients generated by  POLFIT
C     to evaluate the polynomial fit of degree  L , along with the first
C     NDER  of its derivatives, at a specified point.  Computationally
C     stable recurrence relations are used to perform this task.
C
C     The parameters for  PVALUE  are
C
C     Input --
C         L -      the degree of polynomial to be evaluated.  L  may be
C                  any non-negative integer which is less than or equal
C                  to  NDEG , the highest degree polynomial provided
C                  by  POLFIT .
C         NDER -   the number of derivatives to be evaluated.  NDER
C                  may be 0 or any positive value.  If NDER is less
C                  than 0, it will be treated as 0.
C         X -      the argument at which the polynomial and its
C                  derivatives are to be evaluated.
C         A -      work and output array containing values from last
C                  call to  POLFIT .
C
C     Output --
C         YFIT -   value of the fitting polynomial of degree  L  at  X
C         YP -     array containing the first through  NDER  derivatives
C                  of the polynomial of degree  L .  YP  must be
C                  dimensioned at least  NDER  in the calling program.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C
C     Given a collection of points X(I) and a set of values Y(I) which
C     correspond to some function or measurement at each of the X(I),
C     subroutine  DPOLFT  computes the weighted least-squares polynomial
C     fits of all degrees up to some degree either specified by the user
C     or determined by the routine.  The fits thus obtained are in
C     orthogonal polynomial form.  Subroutine  DP1VLU  may then be
C     called to evaluate the fitted polynomials and any of their
C     derivatives at any point.  The subroutine  DPCOEF  may be used to
C     express the polynomial fits as powers of (X-C) for any specified
C     point C.
C
C     The parameters for  DPOLFT  are
C
C     Input -- All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         N -      the number of data points.  The arrays X, Y and W
C                  must be dimensioned at least  N  (N .GE. 1).
C         X -      array of values of the independent variable.  These
C                  values may appear in any order and need not all be
C                  distinct.
C         Y -      array of corresponding function values.
C         W -      array of positive values to be used as weights.  If
C                  W(1) is negative,  DPOLFT  will set all the weights
C                  to 1.0, which means unweighted least squares error
C                  will be minimized.  To minimize relative error, the
C                  user should set the weights to:  W(I) = 1.0/Y(I)**2,
C                  I = 1,...,N .
C         MAXDEG - maximum degree to be allowed for polynomial fit.
C                  MAXDEG  may be any non-negative integer less than  N.
C                  Note -- MAXDEG  cannot be equal to  N-1  when a
C                  statistical test is to be used for degree selection,
C                  i.e., when input value of  EPS  is negative.
C         EPS -    specifies the criterion to be used in determining
C                  the degree of fit to be computed.
C                  (1)  If  EPS  is input negative,  DPOLFT  chooses the
C                       degree based on a statistical F test of
C                       significance.  One of three possible
C                       significance levels will be used:  .01, .05 or
C                       .10.  If  EPS=-1.0 , the routine will
C                       automatically select one of these levels based
C                       on the number of data points and the maximum
C                       degree to be considered.  If  EPS  is input as
C                       -.01, -.05, or -.10, a significance level of
C                       .01, .05, or .10, respectively, will be used.
C                  (2)  If  EPS  is set to 0.,  DPOLFT  computes the
C                       polynomials of degrees 0 through  MAXDEG .
C                  (3)  If  EPS  is input positive,  EPS  is the RMS
C                       error tolerance which must be satisfied by the
C                       fitted polynomial.  DPOLFT  will increase the
C                       degree of fit until this criterion is met or
C                       until the maximum degree is reached.
C
C     Output -- All TYPE REAL variables are DOUBLE PRECISION
C         NDEG -   degree of the highest degree fit computed.
C         EPS -    RMS error of the polynomial of degree  NDEG .
C         R -      vector of dimension at least NDEG containing values
C                  of the fit of degree  NDEG  at each of the  X(I) .
C                  Except when the statistical test is used, these
C                  values are more accurate than results from subroutine
C                  DP1VLU  normally are.
C         IERR -   error flag with the following possible values.
C             1 -- indicates normal execution, i.e., either
C                  (1)  the input value of  EPS  was negative, and the
C                       computed polynomial fit of degree  NDEG
C                       satisfies the specified F test, or
C                  (2)  the input value of  EPS  was 0., and the fits of
C                       all degrees up to  MAXDEG  are complete, or
C                  (3)  the input value of  EPS  was positive, and the
C                       polynomial of degree  NDEG  satisfies the RMS
C                       error requirement.
C             2 -- invalid input parameter.  At least one of the input
C                  parameters has an illegal value and must be corrected
C                  before  DPOLFT  can proceed.  Valid input results
C                  when the following restrictions are observed
C                       N .GE. 1
C                       0 .LE. MAXDEG .LE. N-1  for  EPS .GE. 0.
C                       0 .LE. MAXDEG .LE. N-2  for  EPS .LT. 0.
C                       W(1)=-1.0  or  W(I) .GT. 0., I=1,...,N .
C             3 -- cannot satisfy the RMS error requirement with a
C                  polynomial of degree no greater than  MAXDEG .  Best
C                  fit found is of degree  MAXDEG .
C             4 -- cannot satisfy the test for significance using
C                  current value of  MAXDEG .  Statistically, the
C                  best fit found is of order  NORD .  (In this case,
C                  NDEG will have one of the values:  MAXDEG-2,
C                  MAXDEG-1, or MAXDEG).  Using a higher value of
C                  MAXDEG  may result in passing the test.
C         A -      work and output array having at least 3N+3MAXDEG+3
C                  locations
C
C     Note - DPOLFT  calculates all fits of degrees up to and including
C            NDEG .  Any or all of these fits can be evaluated or
C            expressed as powers of (X-C) using  DP1VLU  and  DPCOEF
C            after just one call to  DPOLFT .

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C
C     Given a collection of points X(I) and a set of values Y(I) which
C     correspond to some function or measurement at each of the X(I),
C     subroutine  POLFIT  computes the weighted least-squares polynomial
C     fits of all degrees up to some degree either specified by the user
C     or determined by the routine.  The fits thus obtained are in
C     orthogonal polynomial form.  Subroutine  PVALUE  may then be
C     called to evaluate the fitted polynomials and any of their
C     derivatives at any point.  The subroutine  PCOEF  may be used to
C     express the polynomial fits as powers of (X-C) for any specified
C     point C.
C
C     The parameters for  POLFIT  are
C
C     Input --
C         N -      the number of data points.  The arrays X, Y and W
C                  must be dimensioned at least  N  (N .GE. 1).
C         X -      array of values of the independent variable.  These
C                  values may appear in any order and need not all be
C                  distinct.
C         Y -      array of corresponding function values.
C         W -      array of positive values to be used as weights.  If
C                  W(1) is negative,  POLFIT  will set all the weights
C                  to 1.0, which means unweighted least squares error
C                  will be minimized.  To minimize relative error, the
C                  user should set the weights to:  W(I) = 1.0/Y(I)**2,
C                  I = 1,...,N .
C         MAXDEG - maximum degree to be allowed for polynomial fit.
C                  MAXDEG  may be any non-negative integer less than  N.
C                  Note -- MAXDEG  cannot be equal to  N-1  when a
C                  statistical test is to be used for degree selection,
C                  i.e., when input value of  EPS  is negative.
C         EPS -    specifies the criterion to be used in determining
C                  the degree of fit to be computed.
C                  (1)  If  EPS  is input negative,  POLFIT  chooses the
C                       degree based on a statistical F test of
C                       significance.  One of three possible
C                       significance levels will be used:  .01, .05 or
C                       .10.  If  EPS=-1.0 , the routine will
C                       automatically select one of these levels based
C                       on the number of data points and the maximum
C                       degree to be considered.  If  EPS  is input as
C                       -.01, -.05, or -.10, a significance level of
C                       .01, .05, or .10, respectively, will be used.
C                  (2)  If  EPS  is set to 0.,  POLFIT  computes the
C                       polynomials of degrees 0 through  MAXDEG .
C                  (3)  If  EPS  is input positive,  EPS  is the RMS
C                       error tolerance which must be satisfied by the
C                       fitted polynomial.  POLFIT  will increase the
C                       degree of fit until this criterion is met or
C                       until the maximum degree is reached.
C
C     Output --
C         NDEG -   degree of the highest degree fit computed.
C         EPS -    RMS error of the polynomial of degree  NDEG .
C         R -      vector of dimension at least NDEG containing values
C                  of the fit of degree  NDEG  at each of the  X(I) .
C                  Except when the statistical test is used, these
C                  values are more accurate than results from subroutine
C                  PVALUE  normally are.
C         IERR -   error flag with the following possible values.
C             1 -- indicates normal execution, i.e., either
C                  (1)  the input value of  EPS  was negative, and the
C                       computed polynomial fit of degree  NDEG
C                       satisfies the specified F test, or
C                  (2)  the input value of  EPS  was 0., and the fits of
C                       all degrees up to  MAXDEG  are complete, or
C                  (3)  the input value of  EPS  was positive, and the
C                       polynomial of degree  NDEG  satisfies the RMS
C                       error requirement.
C             2 -- invalid input parameter.  At least one of the input
C                  parameters has an illegal value and must be corrected
C                  before  POLFIT  can proceed.  Valid input results
C                  when the following restrictions are observed
C                       N .GE. 1
C                       0 .LE. MAXDEG .LE. N-1  for  EPS .GE. 0.
C                       0 .LE. MAXDEG .LE. N-2  for  EPS .LT. 0.
C                       W(1)=-1.0  or  W(I) .GT. 0., I=1,...,N .
C             3 -- cannot satisfy the RMS error requirement with a
C                  polynomial of degree no greater than  MAXDEG .  Best
C                  fit found is of degree  MAXDEG .
C             4 -- cannot satisfy the test for significance using
C                  current value of  MAXDEG .  Statistically, the
C                  best fit found is of order  NORD .  (In this case,
C                  NDEG will have one of the values:  MAXDEG-2,
C                  MAXDEG-1, or MAXDEG).  Using a higher value of
C                  MAXDEG  may result in passing the test.
C         A -      work and output array having at least 3N+3MAXDEG+3
C                  locations
C
C     Note - POLFIT  calculates all fits of degrees up to and including
C            NDEG .  Any or all of these fits can be evaluated or
C            expressed as powers of (X-C) using  PVALUE  and  PCOEF
C            after just one call to  POLFIT .

C     Abstract
C        Allows user control over handling of individual errors.
C        Just after each message is recorded, but before it is
C        processed any further (i.e., before it is printed or
C        a decision to abort is made), a call is made to XERCNT.
C        If the user has provided his own version of XERCNT, he
C        can then override the value of KONTROL used in processing
C        this message by redefining its value.
C        KONTRL may be set to any value from -2 to 2.
C        The meanings for KONTRL are the same as in XSETF, except
C        that the value of KONTRL changes only for this message.
C        If KONTRL is set to a value outside the range from -2 to 2,
C        it will be moved back into that range.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C
C      --Input--
C        LIBRAR - the library that the routine is in.
C        SUBROU - the subroutine that XERMSG is being called from
C        MESSG  - the first 20 characters of the error message.
C        NERR   - same as in the call to XERMSG.
C        LEVEL  - same as in the call to XERMSG.
C        KONTRL - the current value of the control flag as set
C                 by a call to XSETF.
C
C      --Output--
C        KONTRL - the new value of KONTRL.  If KONTRL is not
C                 defined, it will remain at its original value.
C                 This changed value of control affects only
C                 the current occurrence of the current message.

C***CATEGORY  R3C
C***TYPE      ALL (XERMSG-A)
C***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGE, XERROR
C***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C   XERMSG processes a diagnostic message in a manner determined by the
C   value of LEVEL and the current value of the library error control
C   flag, KONTRL.  See subroutine XSETF for details.
C
C    LIBRAR   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
C             of the library.  This will be 'SLATEC' for the SLATEC
C             Common Math Library.  The error handling package is
C             general enough to be used by many libraries
C             simultaneously, so it is desirable for the routine that
C             detects and reports an error to identify the library name
C             as well as the routine name.
C
C    SUBROU   A character constant (or character variable) with the name
C             of the routine that detected the error.  Usually it is the
C             name of the routine that is calling XERMSG.  There are
C             some instances where a user callable library routine calls
C             lower level subsidiary routines where the error is
C             detected.  In such cases it may be more informative to
C             supply the name of the routine the user called rather than
C             the name of the subsidiary routine that detected the
C             error.
C
C    MESSG    A character constant (or character variable) with the text
C             of the error or warning message.  In the example below,
C             the message is a character constant that contains a
C             generic message.
C
C                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY',
C                  *'THE ORDER OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS THE ROW DIMENSION',
C                  *3, 1)
C
C             It is possible (and is sometimes desirable) to generate a
C             specific message--e.g., one that contains actual numeric
C             values.  Specific numeric values can be converted into
C             character strings using formatted WRITE statements into
C             character variables.  This is called standard Fortran
C             internal file I/O and is exemplified in the first three
C             lines of the following example.  You can also catenate
C             substrings of characters to construct the error message.
C             Here is an example showing the use of both writing to
C             an internal file and catenating character strings.
C
C                   CHARACTER*5 CHARN, CHARL
C                   WRITE (CHARN,10) N
C                   WRITE (CHARL,10) LDA
C                10 FORMAT(I5)
C                   CALL XERMSG ('SLATEC', 'MMPY', 'THE ORDER'//CHARN//
C                  *   ' OF THE MATRIX EXCEEDS ITS ROW DIMENSION OF'//
C                  *   CHARL, 3, 1)
C
C             There are two subtleties worth mentioning.  One is that
C             the // for character catenation is used to construct the
C             error message so that no single character constant is
C             continued to the next line.  This avoids confusion as to
C             whether there are trailing blanks at the end of the line.
C             The second is that by catenating the parts of the message
C             as an actual argument rather than encoding the entire
C             message into one large character variable, we avoid
C             having to know how long the message will be in order to
C             declare an adequate length for that large character
C             variable.  XERMSG calls XERPRN to print the message using
C             multiple lines if necessary.  If the message is very long,
C             XERPRN will break it into pieces of 72 characters (as
C             requested by XERMSG) for printing on multiple lines.
C             Also, XERMSG asks XERPRN to prefix each line with ' *  '
C             so that the total line length could be 76 characters.
C             Note also that XERPRN scans the error message backwards
C             to ignore trailing blanks.  Another feature is that
C             the substring '$$' is treated as a new line sentinel
C             by XERPRN.  If you want to construct a multiline
C             message without having to count out multiples of 72
C             characters, just use '$$' as a separator.  '$$'
C             obviously must occur within 72 characters of the
C             start of each line to have its intended effect since
C             XERPRN is asked to wrap around at 72 characters in
C             addition to looking for '$$'.
C
C    NERR     An integer value that is chosen by the library routine's
C             author.  It must be in the range -99 to 999 (three
C             printable digits).  Each distinct error should have its
C             own error number.  These error numbers should be described
C             in the machine readable documentation for the routine.
C             The error numbers need be unique only within each routine,
C             so it is reasonable for each routine to start enumerating
C             errors from 1 and proceeding to the next integer.
C
C    LEVEL    An integer value in the range 0 to 2 that indicates the
C             level (severity) of the error.  Their meanings are
C
C            -1  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
C                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
C                may be needed.  An attempt is made to only print this
C                message once.
C
C             0  A warning message.  This is used if it is not clear
C                that there really is an error, but the user's attention
C                may be needed.
C
C             1  A recoverable error.  This is used even if the error is
C                so serious that the routine cannot return any useful
C                answer.  If the user has told the error package to
C                return after recoverable errors, then XERMSG will
C                return to the Library routine which can then return to
C                the user's routine.  The user may also permit the error
C                package to terminate the program upon encountering a
C                recoverable error.
C
C             2  A fatal error.  XERMSG will not return to its caller
C                after it receives a fatal error.  This level should
C                hardly ever be used; it is much better to allow the
C                user a chance to recover.  An example of one of the few
C                cases in which it is permissible to declare a level 2
C                error is a reverse communication Library routine that
C                is likely to be called repeatedly until it integrates
C                across some interval.  If there is a serious error in
C                the input such that another step cannot be taken and
C                the Library routine is called again without the input
C                error having been corrected by the caller, the Library
C                routine will probably be called forever with improper
C                input.  In this case, it is reasonable to declare the
C                error to be fatal.
C
C    Each of the arguments to XERMSG is input; none will be modified by
C    XERMSG.  A routine may make multiple calls to XERMSG with warning
C    level messages; however, after a call to XERMSG with a recoverable
C    error, the routine should return to the user.  Do not try to call
C    XERMSG with a second recoverable error after the first recoverable
C    error because the error package saves the error number.  The user
C    can retrieve this error number by calling another entry point in
C    the error handling package and then clear the error number when
C    recovering from the error.  Calling XERMSG in succession causes the
C    old error number to be overwritten by the latest error number.
C    This is considered harmless for error numbers associated with
C    warning messages but must not be done for error numbers of serious
C    errors.  After a call to XERMSG with a recoverable error, the user
C    must be given a chance to call NUMXER or XERCLR to retrieve or
C    clear the error number.

C***REVISION HISTORY  (YYMMDD)
C   880101  DATE WRITTEN
C   880621  REVISED AS DIRECTED AT SLATEC CML MEETING OF FEBRUARY 1988.
C           THERE ARE TWO BASIC CHANGES.
C           1.  A NEW ROUTINE, XERPRN, IS USED INSTEAD OF XERPRT TO
C               PRINT MESSAGES.  THIS ROUTINE WILL BREAK LONG MESSAGES
C               INTO PIECES FOR PRINTING ON MULTIPLE LINES.  '$$' IS
C               ACCEPTED AS A NEW LINE SENTINEL.  A PREFIX CAN BE
C               ADDED TO EACH LINE TO BE PRINTED.  XERMSG USES EITHER
C               ' ***' OR ' *  ' AND LONG MESSAGES ARE BROKEN EVERY
C               72 CHARACTERS (AT MOST) SO THAT THE MAXIMUM LINE
C               LENGTH OUTPUT CAN NOW BE AS GREAT AS 76.
C           2.  THE TEXT OF ALL MESSAGES IS NOW IN UPPER CASE SINCE THE
C               FORTRAN STANDARD DOCUMENT DOES NOT ADMIT THE EXISTENCE
C               OF LOWER CASE.
C   880708  REVISED AFTER THE SLATEC CML MEETING OF JUNE 29 AND 30.
C           THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES ARE
C           1.  CLARIFY COMMENTS IN THE PROLOGUES
C           2.  RENAME XRPRNT TO XERPRN
C           3.  REWORK HANDLING OF '$$' IN XERPRN TO HANDLE BLANK LINES
C               SIMILAR TO THE WAY FORMAT STATEMENTS HANDLE THE /
C               CHARACTER FOR NEW RECORDS.
C   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
C           CLEAN UP THE CODING.
C   890721  REVISED TO USE NEW FEATURE IN XERPRN TO COUNT CHARACTERS IN
C           PREFIX.
C   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT COMMENTS.
C   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
C   900510  Changed test on NERR to be -9999999 < NERR < 99999999, but
C           NERR .ne. 0, and on LEVEL to be -2 < LEVEL < 3.  Added

C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  XERPRN
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Print error messages processed by XERMSG.

C***KEYWORDS  ERROR MESSAGES, PRINTING, XERROR
C***AUTHOR  Fong, Kirby, (NMFECC at LLNL)
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C This routine sends one or more lines to each of the (up to five)
C logical units to which error messages are to be sent.  This routine
C is called several times by XERMSG, sometimes with a single line to
C print and sometimes with a (potentially very long) message that may
C wrap around into multiple lines.
C
C PREFIX  Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This argument contains
C         characters to be put at the beginning of each line before
C         the body of the message.  No more than 16 characters of
C         PREFIX will be used.
C
C NPREF   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This argument is the number
C         of characters to use from PREFIX.  If it is negative, the
C         intrinsic function LEN is used to determine its length.  If
C         it is zero, PREFIX is not used.  If it exceeds 16 or if
C         LEN(PREFIX) exceeds 16, only the first 16 characters will be
C         used.  If NPREF is positive and the length of PREFIX is less
C         than NPREF, a copy of PREFIX extended with blanks to length
C         NPREF will be used.
C
C MESSG   Input argument of type CHARACTER.  This is the text of a
C         message to be printed.  If it is a long message, it will be
C         broken into pieces for printing on multiple lines.  Each line
C         will start with the appropriate prefix and be followed by a
C         piece of the message.  NWRAP is the number of characters per
C         piece; that is, after each NWRAP characters, we break and
C         start a new line.  In addition the characters '$$' embedded
C         in MESSG are a sentinel for a new line.  The counting of
C         characters up to NWRAP starts over for each new line.  The
C         value of NWRAP typically used by XERMSG is 72 since many
C         older error messages in the SLATEC Library are laid out to
C         rely on wrap-around every 72 characters.
C
C NWRAP   Input argument of type INTEGER.  This gives the maximum size
C         piece into which to break MESSG for printing on multiple
C         lines.  An embedded '$$' ends a line, and the count restarts
C         at the following character.  If a line break does not occur
C         on a blank (it would split a word) that word is moved to the
C         next line.  Values of NWRAP less than 16 will be treated as
C         16.  Values of NWRAP greater than 132 will be treated as 132.
C         The actual line length will be NPREF + NWRAP after NPREF has
C         been adjusted to fall between 0 and 16 and NWRAP has been
C         adjusted to fall between 16 and 132.

C           THE HANDLING OF THE NEW LINE SENTINEL TO BEHAVE LIKE THE
C           SLASH CHARACTER IN FORMAT STATEMENTS.
C   890706  REVISED WITH THE HELP OF FRED FRITSCH AND REG CLEMENS TO
C           STREAMLINE THE CODING AND FIX A BUG THAT CAUSED EXTRA BLANK
C           LINES TO BE PRINTED.
C   890721  REVISED TO ADD A NEW FEATURE.  A NEGATIVE VALUE OF NPREF
C           CAUSES LEN(PREFIX) TO BE USED AS THE LENGTH.
C   891013  REVISED TO CORRECT ERROR IN CALCULATING PREFIX LENGTH.
C   891214  Prologue converted to Version 4.0 format.  (WRB)
C   900510  Added code to break messages between words.  (RWC)

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     Abstract
C        XGETUA may be called to determine the unit number or numbers
C        to which error messages are being sent.
C        These unit numbers may have been set by a call to XSETUN,
C        or a call to XSETUA, or may be a default value.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Output--
C        IUNIT - an array of one to five unit numbers, depending
C                on the value of N.  A value of zero refers to the
C                default unit, as defined by the I1MACH machine
C                constant routine.  Only IUNIT(1),...,IUNIT(N) are
C                defined by XGETUA.  The values of IUNIT(N+1),...,
C                IUNIT(5) are not defined (for N .LT. 5) or altered
C                in any way by XGETUA.
C        N     - the number of units to which copies of the
C                error messages are being sent.  N will be in the
C                range from 1 to 5.
